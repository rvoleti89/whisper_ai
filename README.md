## Install requirements
This code was written using the latest release of **Python 3.8**.

Ensure the additional requirements are installed by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` in your python environment. This code should not require anything other than numpy, scipy, seaborn, matplotlib >= 3.4.0, and jupyter (for my convolution implementation).

The main submission is the file `whisper_interview.py`. Please note the following:
 * The functions `decimate_by_2()` and `downsample_by_2()` are defined here along with a `main()` function that tests the code and makes a few plots.
 * Code can be run on the command line with `python whisper_interview.py` to view the results of the main function call
 
Additionally, I have done a manual implementation of the convolution operation using just numpy and a for loop. You can see the details of that in the included jupyter notebook `whisper_convolution.ipynb` file.

Thank you for considering my application!
